# Ability damage analysis

## Local development

To run this project locally, install Node.js v20 from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en).  
Alternatively, use a node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).  

Make sure your nodejs install directory is stored in your PATH variables, you can check this by running `node -v`.

Once you can see the node version in the console, run the following commands and a browser window should open to https://localhost:3000 automatically.
```
cd ability-damage-analysis

npm i

npm run dev
```
